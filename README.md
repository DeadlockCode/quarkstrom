# Quarkstrom
This is the official repository for the code shown in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEnglRKNHjU).
To the one person who is going to use this, I'm sorry for what you're about to go through.
I made it for myself and therefore there is no documentation and the 'API' (if you can even call it that) is lacking.

Assuming you already have rust installed, 
1. Run "cargo run --release" to compile and run the particle life simulation ([main.rs](https://github.com/DenneMan/quarkstrom/blob/master/src/main.rs)) shown at the end of the video.
2. Add "quarkstrom = {path = "path/to/this/folder"}" to cargo.toml to use the library ([lib.rs](https://github.com/DenneMan/quarkstrom/blob/master/src/lib.rs)) in other projects.

Quarkstrom = Quark + Maelstrom
